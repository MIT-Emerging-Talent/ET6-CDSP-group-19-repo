# Communication Strategy

## Introduction

The **“Barriers to Justice”** project investigates how recent changes in U.S.
immigration policy have impacted immigrant juveniles’ access to legal
representation and case outcomes. Recognizing that research is only valuable if
it reaches and empowers the right people, we designed a communication strategy
tailored to two core audiences: professionals on the front lines of immigrant
youth advocacy (primarily in NGOs), and legal scholars or researchers shaping
the policy discourse. Our goal is not only to share data, but to spark learning,
inspire change, and lower the barriers to justice for vulnerable youth.

## Who Are We Trying to Reach?

### NGO Professionals Advocating for Immigrant Youth

These are attorneys, case workers, and policy advocates working within
organizations like **KIND** (Kids in Need of Defense), **NIJC** (National Immigrant
Justice Center), **ILRC** (Immigrant Legal Resource Center) and similar groups.
They have deep knowledge of the legal landscape
and work directly with young people facing deportation or seeking protection.

- **Capabilities:** Legal expertise, direct service delivery, policy engagement,
  rapid problem-solving.
- **Constraints:** High caseloads, shifting policy environments, funding
  limitations, limited time for research.

> **Persona 1: Elena Reyes, Legal Training Coordinator (36)**  
>
> - **Works at:** KIND (Kids in Need of Defense), Washington D.C. office  
> - **Professional background:** Immigration attorney with ~8 years of experience,
>   currently coordinates training programs for volunteer lawyers representing
>   unaccompanied minors pro bono (free of charge)  
> - **Daily reality:** Develops training materials; reviews case outcomes to identify
>   effective advocacy strategies; supports policy advocacy efforts based on case
>   trends  
> - **Information needs:** Evidence-based practices proven to improve case outcomes;
>   jurisdiction-specific data to tailor training content; impactful statistics to
>   support advocacy campaigns  
> - **Digital habits:** Keeps up with immigration policy updates on Twitter; shares
>   resources in legal aid forums and occasionally on Medium; mainly communicates
>   via email and webinars  

### Legal Scholars & Immigration Policy Researchers

These include law school faculty, graduate students, think tank analysts, and
policy specialists at institutes such as **Harvard Law, NYU, UCLA, Migration
Policy Institute, and Vera Institute of Justice.** They use rigorous data and
case studies to drive legal scholarship, inform policymakers, and shape future
reforms.

- **Capabilities:** Critical analysis, academic publishing, data interpretation,
  policy influence.
- **Constraints:** Need for credible, well-documented data; limited access to
  anonymized juvenile case files; time spent on data cleaning.

> - **Works at:** Vera Institute of Justice, Center on Immigration and Justice
> - **Professional background:** Policy analyst with extensive experience (10+ years)
>   in immigration research and statistical analysis focusing on systemic barriers
>   in immigration courts  
> - **Current projects:** Comparing representation disparities across multiple U.S.
>   jurisdictions; formulating data-driven recommendations for court reform
> - **Information needs:** Robust, methodologically sound datasets; comparative
>   regional data; clear evidence of policy impacts on immigrant youth case outcomes
> - **Digital habits:** Frequently searches academic journals and repositories; attends
>   webinars and conferences; collaborates through shared datasets and code
>   repositories; occasionally shares findings on Medium

## How Will We Reach Them?

### Primary Channel: Interactive Website

We determined that an [interactive website][1]* is the most effective way to reach
both NGOs and researchers. This platform offers:

- **Accessible, multi-layered content:** From bite-sized key findings and data
  visualizations to downloadable datasets, users can engage at the depth they need.
- **Anonymity and safety:** Sensitive data is de-identified to protect both
  contributors and subjects, especially important given ongoing legal cases.
- **Trust and credibility:** Transparent presentation of methods, code, and
  results supports confidence and reproducibility.
- **Scalability:** The site can be updated and expanded as new data or feedback
  emerges, and can serve as a hub for collaboration among advocates and scholars.

Reflecting on the needs outlined in the personas above, the website is designed to
support users like Elena and David by providing accessible data visualizations,
downloadable statistics, and sharable content suitable for advocacy and
research dissemination.

### Supporting Channels

To broaden our reach, we plan to share select findings as accessible
infographics on [Medium][2], a popular publishing platform geared toward
thoughtful commentary and accessible storytelling.
This will help bridge the gap between technical research
and public understanding, while directing interested readers to our main website.

For academic audiences, we are additionally preparing a research paper draft
summarizing our methods and results.  
Although this paper is currently in
progress, sharing even preliminary findings helps establish credibility and
invites scholarly feedback. (If completed, it will be made available through the
website and submitted for publication to journals such as Harvard Law Review.)

### Direct Outreach via Email

While our website serves as the main platform for our research, we recognize that
even the most comprehensive resources require proactive promotion to reach their
intended audiences. Direct outreach bridges this discovery gap by ensuring our
work reaches key organizations and researchers who can benefit from and build
upon our findings.

To support this effort, we plan to contact key organizations, particularly KIND and
researchers focused on immigration policy, through personalized emails. These
messages will briefly present our main findings and invite recipients to explore
our interactive website and GitHub repository. We will also include a summary PDF
for those seeking additional detail and highlight our team’s diverse academic
backgrounds and shared commitment to collaborative, impact-driven work.

This personalized approach complements our digital strategy and helps ensure our
research reaches those best positioned to apply its insights in advocacy, policy
development, and beyond.

## What Do We Want Them to Learn?

- How legal representation or lack thereof affects case outcomes for immigrant
  juveniles.
- The tangible effects of recent U.S. policy shifts on access to justice for
  young people.
- How different demographic and systemic factors interact with legal outcomes.
- Where representation barriers are most acute across jurisdictions.
- Evidence-based strategies that have improved outcomes in specific contexts.

## How Do We Hope They Will Act?

- **NGO professionals** may use our findings to advocate for increased resources,
  design more effective support programs, train staff with up-to-date evidence,
  or strengthen grant applications with compelling data.
- **Researchers** can use our datasets and reproducible code for further study,
  cite our work in publications, identify underexplored gaps, and join the
  conversation on reform.

## Why Is This Strategy Effective?

A website offers the flexibility, accessibility, and trust required for our
audiences; serving as a living resource that grows with the project.  
Supporting
channels like Medium and a research paper allow us to meet different users
where they are, while always grounding our communication in evidence and empathy.
