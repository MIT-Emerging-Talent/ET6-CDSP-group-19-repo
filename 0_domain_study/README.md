# Domain Study: Immigration Law & Juvenile Justice Systems (United States)

## Research Process Overview

Our team followed a **divergent → convergent** workflow:

1. **Divergent phase** –
mapped multiple domains (education, climate, health, immigration).  
2. **Background scanning** –
collected key papers, the EOIR dataset, NGO reports, and recent news.  
3. **FRESCO scoring** –
ranked each draft question on
Feasibility, Relevance, Ethics, Specificity, Complexity, and Originality.  
4. **Convergent phase** –
immigration & juvenile justice emerged as the top-scoring domain
(see full notes →

).
5. **Focus refinement** –
narrowed scope to *access to counsel* and *case outcomes* for immigrant juveniles.

This process culminated in the research question below.
