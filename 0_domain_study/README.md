# Domain Study: Immigration Law & Juvenile Justice Systems (United States)

## Research Process Overview

A **divergent → convergent** workflow was followed by our team:

1. **Divergent phase** –
   Multiple domains (education, climate, health, immigration) were mapped.  
2. **Background scanning** –
   Key papers, the EOIR dataset, NGO reports, and recent news were collected.  
3. **FRESCO scoring** –
   Each draft question was ranked on Feasibility, Relevance, Ethics, Specificity,
   Complexity, and Originality.  
4. **Convergent phase** –
   Immigration & juvenile justice emerged as the top-scoring domain.

5. **Focus refinement** –
   The scope was narrowed to *access to counsel* and *case outcomes* for
   immigrant juveniles.

The research question below was culminated in by this process.

## Problem Statement

Significant and growing barriers are faced by immigrant juveniles navigating
the U.S. immigration system, especially due to recent policy changes that
restrict access to legal representation and critical support services. Without
proper legal aid, court interpreters, or guidance, many children — often
appearing in court alone — are unable to effectively advocate for their
protection and fair treatment. Longer detention times, increased court backlogs,
and language barriers compound this vulnerability and severely impact the
chances of securing safety and reunification. As displaced students and
community members familiar with these struggles, systemic gaps
disproportionately harm immigrant children, placing thousands at risk of
deportation and trauma. These challenges are aimed to be shed light on by this
project, advocating for urgent reforms to ensure equitable legal protection
for immigrant youth.

## Background Review

Growing challenges are faced by immigrant juveniles in the U.S. due to stricter
immigration policies, especially under the Trump administration. New rules make
it harder for children in ORR custody to reunite with family by imposing tough
sponsor requirements like DNA tests and proof of income. Legal aid funding cuts
leave many children to face immigration courts alone, reducing their chances
of staying in the country. Increased involvement of immigration enforcement in
child welfare discourages families from sponsoring these children. Systemic
barriers that prolong detention and increase the risk of deportation for
vulnerable immigrant youths are created by these policies.

## Group Understanding & Breaking Down of the Background Review

Systems thinking was applied to the topic domain and the four previously cited
articles to understand the complex, interconnected issues immigrant juveniles face
in accessing legal representation and reuniting with family in the U.S. These
systemic challenges result from evolving immigration policies, funding instability,
enforcement practices, and underlying beliefs about immigrant children and legal
rights. An overview organized into events, patterns/trends, structural factors, and
mental models shaping this system is below:

### Events

- Funding for legal representation of nearly 26,000 unaccompanied migrant children
  was ended by the Trump administration, severely limiting access to counsel.  
- Prolonged detention is faced by children due to new, restrictive sponsor
  eligibility requirements, including DNA testing, proof of income, and biometric
  data.
- Surprise “welfare checks” at potential sponsors’ homes are conducted by ICE
  and DHS, deterring families from stepping forward.  
- Deportation hearings are frequently fast-tracked, pressuring children to represent
  themselves without adequate legal support.  
- Unstable funding and reduced capacity are struggled with by legal aid organizations.

### Patterns / Trends

- A consistent rise in unrepresented immigrant juveniles correlates with stricter
  immigration policies.  
- Much lower appearance rates in court and higher deportation risks are seen in
  children without attorneys.  
- Detention times have tripled on average, causing increased trauma and distress.
- Families increasingly avoid sponsoring due to fear of enforcement actions.  
- Political shifts make legal aid funding vulnerable, undermining long-term support.

### Structure

- Legal representation for juveniles is not guaranteed by immigration courts, unlike
  criminal courts.  
- Federal contracts, subject to abrupt termination, determine legal aid stability.
- Complex and invasive documentation requirements are involved in sponsor approval.
- “Rocket docket” procedures rushing hearings and disadvantaging unrepresented children
  are used by court systems.  
- Capacity to respond quickly to policy changes is lacking in support systems (non-profits,
  social services).

### Mental Models

- Legal representation for immigrant children is widely viewed as discretionary,
  not a right.
- Child welfare is often deprioritized in favor of immigration enforcement.  
- Assumptions persist that stricter enforcement deters migration, even at
  children’s expense.
- Some policymakers and system actors believe children can self-represent or
  do not deserve counsel.
- ***Every child deserves protection, fairness, and legal voice, regardless of
  immigration status*** is held by our group.

The systemic issues and prevailing mental models outlined above set the context for
our research focus. These insights motivated the formulation of the following research
question, which aims to examine how changes in U.S. immigration policy affect access
to legal representation and case outcomes for immigrant juveniles.

## Research Question

**“How do changes in U.S. immigration policy under the current administration affect
access to legal representation and outcomes for immigrant juveniles seeking protection?”**

### Context & Constraints

**Domain:** U.S. immigration law and policy, focused on juveniles (minors)
seeking legal protection (e.g., asylum, Special Immigrant Juvenile Status).

**Realities:** Immigration policy is dynamic and politically influenced;
juvenile immigrants face complex barriers navigating the legal system; access to
legal counsel is crucial for fair outcomes.

#### Constraints

- Data on representation and case outcomes may be fragmented (court records,
  NGO data, government statistics). Policy changes may not be immediately or
  transparently reflected in public data.  
- Privacy concerns for minors; potential bias in available datasets.  
- Defining the appropriate time window may be required. The study can be nationwide
  or limited to areas with sufficient or high-priority data.

### Research Objectives

The objectives depend on data availability and are structured to ensure meaningful
answers to the research question:

#### ➡️ If sufficient data exists for direct comparison

- The main policy changes affecting immigrant juveniles since January 20, 2025
  will be identified.  
- The impact of these changes on the availability and accessibility of legal support
  for juveniles will be analyzed.  
- The percentage of deportation cases involving immigrant juveniles before and
  after these policy changes will be assessed and compared.

#### ➡️ If sufficient data does not exist for direct comparison

- The main policy changes affecting immigrant juveniles since January 20, 2025
  will be identified.  
- Whether and how legal representation generally affects juvenile case outcomes,
  based on prior data (before those policy changes), will be investigated.  
- The potential effect of these policy changes on future case outcomes for
  immigrant juveniles will be predicted.
