## Problem Statement

Immigrant juveniles in the U.S. face serious barriers to legal
representation, especially under recent changes in immigration policy.
These policies have increased case backlogs, limited access to legal aid,
and negatively affected outcomes for children seeking protection.
Our group aims to understand how these systemic issues shaped by shifting
policies, institutional structures, and public attitudes impact vulnerable
youth and what can be done to improve fairness and access to justice.

## Understanding the problem domain

We applied systems thinking to the topic domain and the four previously cited
articles, to understand the complex, interconnected issues immigrant juveniles
face in accessing legal representation and reuniting with family in the U.S.
These systemic challenges result from evolving immigration policies, funding
instability, enforcement practices, and underlying beliefs about immigrant
children and legal rights. Below is an overview organized into events,
patterns/trends, structural factors, and mental models shaping this system: [0_domain_study](README.md)
