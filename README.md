# Barriers to Justice

How Immigration Policies Affect Immigrant Juveniles Seeking Protection

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore how recent changes in U.S. immigration
policy under the current administration are affecting immigrant juvenilesâ€™
access to legal representation and the outcomes of their protection cases.

Our key questions include:

- How have recent policy shifts impacted access to legal aid for immigrant juveniles?
- What are the trends in case outcomes for unrepresented versus represented youth?
- What structural or systemic factors contribute to the legal gap?

## Problem Statement

Immigrant juveniles in the U.S. face serious barriers to legal
representation, especially under recent changes in immigration policy.
These policies have increased case backlogs, limited access to legal aid,
and negatively affected outcomes for children seeking protection.
Our group aims to understand how these systemic issues shaped by shifting
policies, institutional structures, and public attitudes impact vulnerable
youth and what can be done to improve fairness and access to justice.

## Understanding the Problem Domain

We applied systems thinking to the topic domain to understand the complex,
interconnected issues immigrant juveniles face in accessing legal representation
and reuniting with family in the U.S.
These systemic challenges result from increasingly restrictive immigration
policies, funding instability, enforcement practices, and underlying beliefs
about immigrant children and legal rights.

structures, and underlying mental models, check out the full overview:

## Non-Technical Explanation of Our Domain Model  

Our domain model aims to translate the real-world system of immigration policy,
legal representation, and juvenile case outcomes into data we can analyze.
Below is how we chose to model the data and what limitations
we recognize in this approach.

### âœ… Features We Will Collect for Each Case  

We will represent each case using the following features:

- **Case ID**
- **Date of filing / decision**
- **Case duration** (derived from filing and decision dates)
- **Interpreter need** (yes/no) â€” *if available*
- **Age of juvenile**
- **Country of origin**
- **Type of case** (e.g., asylum, deportation)
- **Legal representation status** (yes/no)
- **Outcome** (e.g., granted, denied, closed)
- **Court location / region**
- **Policy period** (before/after specific policy X)

### âœ… Policy Changes Modeling  

We will model policy change data by:

- Identifying relevant policy changes connected to juvenile immigration cases.
- Describing what exactly changed in these policies.
- Explaining how the changes affect juveniles.
- Recording the date of each change.
- Representing this information as structured descriptive data
(e.g., a table of policy changes with dates and impact descriptions).

ðŸ‘‰ We will also create a separate document summarizing the policies that have
changed, their role in protecting juveniles, and how the changes affect them.

### âœ… Modeling Impact on Legal Representation and Case Outcomes  

- We will collect and compare the **percentage of legally represented cases**
before and after policy change.

  ðŸ‘‰ To keep our model practical and manageable:
**Legal representation** will be modeled as a binary **yes/no** variable.
We will not differentiate types of representation (e.g., NGO, private).

- We will collect and compare the **percentage of deportation outcomes**
before and after each policy change.

  âš  **Limitation in this approach:**  
Comparing deportation percentages alone doesnâ€™t isolate the effect of legal
representation, as other factors like case complexity and selection bias may
influence outcomes.

  ðŸ‘‰ To address this, we will compare:

- The **deportation rate in legally represented cases**
before vs after the policy change.
- The **deportation rate in unrepresented cases** before vs after the policy change.

We will also explore other possible factors, such as **language barriers**,
where data allows.

### ðŸ§± Possible Flaws or Limitations  

- **Public datasets may not always be complete:** Some cases might have
missing values (e.g., no outcome listed) or inconsistently reported fields
(e.g., legal aid marked differently across courts).
This could reduce the reliability or comparability of some features.

- **Generalization:** Not every case or region is the same,
but our model looks at the system broadly.

- **No direct feedback from affected youth:** Our insights are based
on secondhand reports and research, not lived experiences.

- **Causation vs. correlation:** Our analysis may identify associations
between policy changes and outcomes, but cannot definitively establish
that policy changes directly caused the observed differences, as other
factors may have changed simultaneously (e.g. socioeconomic conditions in origin
countries, or shifts in legal aid funding).

- **Selection bias in legal representation:** Juveniles who obtain legal
representation may systematically differ from those who don't (e.g.,
less/more complex cases, worse/better economic resources, living in rural or urban
areas), which could confound our analysis of representation effects.

- **Time lag effects:** Policy changes may take months to fully implement
and show measurable effects. Our before/after comparison approach may
not capture delayed impacts or gradual implementation phases.
