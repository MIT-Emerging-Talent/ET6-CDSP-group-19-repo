# Barriers to Justice

How Immigration Policies Affect Immigrant Juveniles Seeking Protection

## Project Overview & Problem Statement

Immigrant juveniles in the U.S. face serious barriers to legal representation,
particularly under recent changes in immigration policy.
These policies have increased case backlogs, limited access to legal aid,
and negatively affected outcomes for children seeking protection.

This research examines how these policy changes have affected immigrant juveniles'
access to legal representation and the outcomes of their protection cases.
The study seeks to understand how systemic issues, shaped by shifting policies,
institutional structures, and public attitudes, impact vulnerable youth and
identify potential interventions to improve fairness and access to justice.

The study addresses these key questions:

- How have recent policy shifts impacted access to legal aid for immigrant juveniles?
- What trends can be observed in case outcomes between represented and unrepresented
  youth?
- Which structural or systemic factors contribute to the identified legal representation
  gap?

## Domain Analysis & Conceptual Framework

### Systems Approach

Systems thinking was applied to understand the complex, interconnected issues
immigrant juveniles face in accessing legal representation and reuniting with
family in the U.S. These systemic challenges result from increasingly
restrictive immigration policies, funding instability, enforcement practices,
and underlying beliefs about immigrant children and legal rights.

### Actionable Research Question

***"How do changes in U.S. immigration policy under the current administration
affect access to legal representation and outcomes for immigrant juveniles
seeking protection?"***

## Non-Technical Explanation of the Domain Model  

The domain model translates the real-world system of immigration policy,
legal representation, and juvenile case outcomes into analyzable data.
Below is how the data was modeled and what limitations
are recognized in this approach.

### ‚úÖ Features Collected for Each Case  

Each case is represented using the following features:

- **Case ID**
- **Date of filing / decision**
- **Case duration** (derived from filing and decision dates)
- **Interpreter need** (yes/no) ‚Äî *if available*
- **Age of juvenile**
- **Country of origin**
- **Type of case** (e.g., asylum, deportation)
- **Legal representation status** (yes/no)
- **Outcome** (e.g., granted, denied, closed)
- **Court location / region**
- **Policy period** (before/after specific policy X)

### ‚úÖ Policy Changes Modeling  

Policy change data is modeled by:

- Identifying relevant policy changes connected to juvenile immigration cases.
- Describing what exactly changed in these policies.
- Explaining how the changes affect juveniles.
- Recording the date of each change.
- Representing this information as structured descriptive data
(e.g., a table of policy changes with dates and impact descriptions).

üìå [A separate document][1] was created summarizing the policies that have
changed, their role in protecting juveniles, and how the changes affect them.

[1]: 3_data_exploration/policy_impact_review.md

### ‚úÖ Modeling Impact on Legal Representation and Case Outcomes  

The percentage of legally represented cases before and after policy change was
collected and compared.

üëâ **To keep the model practical and manageable:**

- Legal representation was modeled as a binary yes/no variable.
- Types of representation (e.g., NGO, private) were not differentiated.

The percentage of deportation outcomes before and after each policy change was
collected and compared.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitation in this approach:**

- Comparing deportation percentages alone doesn‚Äôt isolate the effect of legal representation,
  as other factors like case complexity and selection bias may influence outcomes.

üëâ **To address this, the following comparisons were made:**

- The deportation rate in legally represented cases before vs after the policy change.
- The deportation rate in unrepresented cases before vs after the policy change.
- Other possible factors, such as language barriers, were also explored where
  data allowed.

### üß± Possible Flaws or Limitations  

- **Public datasets may not always be complete:** Some cases might have
missing values (e.g., no outcome listed) or inconsistently reported fields
(e.g., legal aid marked differently across courts).
This could reduce the reliability or comparability of some features.

- **Generalization:** Not every case or region is the same,
but the model examines the system broadly.

- **No direct feedback from affected youth:** The insights are based
on secondhand reports and research, not lived experiences.

- **Causation vs. correlation:** Our analysis may identify associations
between policy changes and outcomes, but cannot definitively establish
that policy changes directly caused the observed differences, as other
factors may have changed simultaneously (e.g. socioeconomic conditions in origin
countries, or shifts in legal aid funding).

- **Selection bias in legal representation:** Juveniles who obtain legal
representation may systematically differ from those who don't (e.g.,
less/more complex cases, worse/better economic resources, living in rural or urban
areas), which could confound our analysis of representation effects.

- **Time lag effects:** Policy changes may take months to fully implement
and show measurable effects. Our before/after comparison approach may
not capture delayed impacts or gradual implementation phases.

## Data and Methodology

### Dataset Overview

**Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) Case Data**  
Source: [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/eoir-case-data)

Monthly case-level immigration court data are released by the EOIR through
the U.S. Department of Justice. The dataset is collected and updated regularly
via official government systems and includes information on individual court proceedings.

### Population Represented

The dataset represents juvenile immigrants (typically unaccompanied children) who:

- Were involved in U.S. immigration court proceedings between FY 2020-2025
- Were identified as under 18 years old at the time of case filing
- Were seeking various forms of relief (asylum, withholding of removal, etc.)
- Represented diverse countries of origin, predominantly from Central America
- Had varying access to legal representation across jurisdictions

### Research Purpose

The dataset was created to support analysis of how changes in U.S. immigration
policy under the current administration have impacted:

- Access to legal representation for immigrant juveniles
- Case outcomes such as asylum granted, denied, or terminated
- Processing times and procedural fairness in juvenile cases
- Regional and demographic disparities in legal outcomes

### Data Files

Files included in this dataset (available via Google Drive due to size limitations):

- **juvenile_cases_cleaned.csv.gz** - 1.8 million demographic and procedural records
- **juvenile_history_cleaned.csv.gz** - Records linking juveniles to proceedings
- **juvenile_proceedings_cleaned.csv.gz** - Records of appearances and decisions
- **juvenile_reps_assigned.csv.gz** - Records of legal representation assignments
- **tblLookup_Juvenile.csv** - Reference table for juvenile categories
- **tblDecCode.csv** - Reference table for decision code descriptions

**Note:** Due to the large size of these datasets, files are not included directly
in this repository.
To replicate the analysis,
download these files from the shared [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1gv42BRnm6blapzoDEbYbFf6M1IXZJXcL)
and place them in the working directory.

### Data Preparation

Raw data required significant preprocessing to transform it into an analyzable format.
The data preparation process included:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicate records, handling missing values, and
  correcting inconsistent entries
- **Data Integration**: Merging separate tables to create comprehensive
  juvenile case records
- **Data Validation**: Implementing quality checks to ensure data integrity and consistency
- **Standardization**: Normalizing fields like court locations and case types for
  consistent analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Before conducting formal hypothesis testing, exploratory analysis was performed to:

- **Identify Patterns**: Visualize distributions and relationships between variables
- **Detect Anomalies**: Find outliers and unusual patterns requiring investigation
- **Assess Data Quality**: Evaluate the completeness and reliability of key variables
- **Inform Modeling**: Determine appropriate statistical approaches based on
  data characteristics

### Analytical Approach

This study examined how legal representation and case outcomes for juvenile
immigrants evolved across major U.S. federal immigration policy periods
(2018‚Äì2025).  

The analysis included:

1. **Time Series Analysis:**  
   Trends in legal representation and case outcomes were visualized over
   time and by policy period.

2. **Statistical Testing:**  
   Associations between policy era, legal representation, and case outcomes
   were assessed using chi-square tests.  
   Effect sizes (Cramer's V) were
   calculated to evaluate the practical significance of observed relationships.

3. **Regression Modeling:**  
   Logistic regression was used to estimate the influence of legal
   representation, policy era, age, and gender on case outcomes.

Additionally, because these policy periods closely align with presidential
terms, our analysis also captures the broader influence of different political
administrations on juvenile immigration outcomes.

#### Analytical Constraints & Limitations

This analytical approach was shaped by several constraints and design decisions:

- **Omitted Variables and Unused Dimensions**  
  Certain variables and analysis directions‚Äîsuch as nationality and court
  region‚Äîwere considered in early planning but ultimately not included.  
  - Nationality was excluded from the regression due to high cardinality and
  interpretability concerns.
  - Court or regional-level comparisons were not
  pursued due to time constraints, data complexity, and the team's limited
  capacity.  

  While both areas could offer valuable insights, the study focused
  on core variables to ensure a clear and tractable analysis.

- **Data Structure and Quality Limitations**  
  The dataset was very large but often inconsistent. Some portions included missing,
  inaccurate, or corrupted entries. Others displayed structural complexity,
  making it difficult to perform clean and comprehensive comparisons.

- **Temporal Ambiguity in Policy Changes**  
  Precise start and end dates for immigration policy changes were often unclear
  or not verifiable through direct government sources.

  To address this, policy periods were defined based on presidential terms and
  anchored in major documented immigration policy changes during each era, as:
  - **Trump Era I (Zero Tolerance Policy Era)**: *April 2018 ‚Äì January 2021*  
  - **Biden Era (Policy Stability)**: *January 2021 ‚Äì April 2025*  
  - **Trump Era II (Funding Cut Era)**: *April 2025 ‚Äì Present*

## Key Findings

The comprehensive analysis revealed several important insights about immigration
policy impacts on juvenile cases:

### 1. Policy Impact on Case Outcomes

The Biden era was associated with significantly higher odds of favorable outcomes
compared to the Trump eras.  
Policy era showed a statistically significant but small relationship with case outcomes
**(œá¬≤ = 29,427.96, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.177)**.

**Favorable Outcome Rates by Policy Era:**

- **Biden Era (Jan 2021 ‚Äì Apr 2025)**: 37.1% favorable outcomes
- **Trump Era I (Apr 2018 ‚Äì Jan 2021)**: 20.6% favorable outcomes  
- **Trump Era II (Apr 2025 ‚Äì Present)**: 22.7% favorable outcomes

### 2. Legal Representation Patterns

Legal representation rates showed a negligible relationship with policy changes
**(œá¬≤ = 1,643.51, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.042)**.  
Representation rates averaged 37-40% across all policy periods, with some fluctuation
but no clear systematic pattern.

**Representation Rates by Policy Era:**

- **Biden Era**: 43.3% represented
- **Trump Era I**: 40.1% represented
- **Trump Era II**: 51.1% represented

### 3. Critical Impact of Legal Representation

Legal representation emerged as the strongest predictor of favorable outcomes,
with a medium effect size **(œá¬≤ = 90,865.53, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.310)**.  
Juveniles with legal representation were over 5 times more likely to achieve
favorable outcomes **(odds ratio: 5.46)**.

**Outcome Rates by Representation Status:**

- **Represented cases**: 46.9% favorable outcomes
- **Unrepresented cases**: 18.0% favorable outcomes

### 4. Demographic Factors

The analysis revealed modest but significant demographic effects:

- **Gender**: Females had slightly higher odds of favorable outcomes
  **(odds ratio: 1.24)**
- **Age**: Younger children (under 12) and older teens (16-17) faced lower
  odds of success **(odds ratios: 0.73 and 0.91, respectively)**  
  Ages 12-15 had no significant difference in outcomes compared to the
  reference group **(odds ratio: 1.00)**

### 5. Model Performance and Limitations

The predictive model achieved moderate performance **(accuracy: 0.689, AUC-ROC: 0.723)**,
indicating meaningful but limited predictive power.  
This suggests that substantial factors influencing case outcomes remain unmeasured
in the available data.
