# Milestone 4️⃣ – Meeting Minutes

---

## Meeting 14 – July 28, 2025  

**Time:** 10:30 AM – 12:00 PM ET  
**Attendees:** Amro, Azza, Ammar, Gennadii, Banu, Ramon, Muhammed  
**Facilitator:** Amro  

### Agenda Summary  

- Initially, the team analyzed the relationship between legal representation and
  policy eras, assuming results lacked practical significance.  
- Discussion on shifting focus to case outcomes took place.  
- Further research and Slack clarification showed the relationship was
  statistically significant (χ² = 1,643.51, p < 0.001), but effect size was
  negligible (Cramer’s V = 0.042, df = 2).  
- The team decided to continue analyzing both relationships: policy vs. legal
  representation and policy vs. case outcomes.  
- Case outcomes analysis showed a small but meaningful effect size (χ² =
  29,427.96, p < 0.001, Cramer’s V = 0.177, df = 2) and was chosen as the primary
  focus.  
- Limited data for the Trump II era and high legal representation rate there were
  identified as potential confounding factors.  
- The team agreed to document these observations for transparency.  
- A full review of the repository before the July 31 presentation was planned.  
- The group discussed structuring and completing the PowerPoint draft.  
- A peer review strategy was defined: one member to review Group 20’s repository
  and provide feedback.  
- Milestone 4 deliverables were reviewed; possible target audiences and
  communication artifacts were explored.  
- Potential target groups: NGOs, law/political science students and researchers,
  newspapers.  
- Three artifact formats considered: research paper, website, presentation.  
- Pros and cons were discussed, with no final decision; the topic may be raised
  at the milestone check-in session for Evan’s input.  

### Action Items  

- Ammar to improve the data analysis notebook.  
- Banu to update the main README file.  
- Amro to prepare the July 31 presentation.  
- Azza to review the data-exploration folder.  
- Muhammet Ali to conduct the peer review task.  
- Continue brainstorming Milestone 4 deliverables and communication strategies.
