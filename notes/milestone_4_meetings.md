<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->
<!--
  MD024 is disabled here because we intentionally repeat headers like 
  "Agenda Summary" and "Action Items" in each meeting's notes to maintain 
  consistent structure and clarity. These duplicates are purposeful 
  and improve readability within separate meeting sections.
  Ignoring this rule prevents unnecessary lint warnings for valid cases.
