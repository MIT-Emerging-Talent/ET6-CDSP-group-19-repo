## Milestone 2 ðŸ“ŠðŸ“‹

### Gennadii Ershov

- Build foundational knowledge in immigration law
- Develop best practices for working with large datasets

### Banu Ozyilmaz

- I would like to improve how I document technical work.
- I hope to learn how to break down big research questions into
clear data steps, so I can become familiar with which data to
collect and how to prepare it.
- I want to focus on steady progress instead of perfection,
and remind myself that growth happens when I face challenges.

### Muhammad Shahroz

- Get more active in team discussions and improve my communication.
- Learn the basics of working with large, real-world datasets.
- Get better at breaking down project tasks so I can contribute more consistently.
- Understand the core project workflow and how my work fits into the teamâ€™s goals.

### Amro

- Understand how to define a data collection strategy aligned with the research question.
- Identify relevant and credible data sources (e.g., TRAC, EOIR, news reports).
- Practice extracting structured data from semi-structured or
unstructured formats (e.g., articles, CSVs).
- Learn how to document data provenanceâ€”where your data came from,
how it was processed, and any assumptions made.
- Apply data cleaning techniques (handling missing data,
reformatting, filtering by age).
- Learn how to collaborate in a team when collecting and verifying data.

### Azza Omer

- Learn how to turn big research questions into smaller,
manageable steps to figure out what data is needed and how to prepare it.
- Gain a basic understanding of immigration law to help make
sense of the data.
- Practice turning messy or unstructured data
(like articles or raw CSV files)into clean, organized data you can work with.
- Understand how to track where data comes from and how it was processed.
- cleaning dataâ€”like filling in missing values,
reformatting columns, or filtering based on age.
