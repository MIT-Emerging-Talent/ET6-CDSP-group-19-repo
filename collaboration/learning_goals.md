### Milestone 2

#### Gennadii Ershov

- Build foundational knowledge in immigration law
- Develop best practices for working with large datasets

#### Banu Ozyilmaz

- I would like to improve how I document technical work.
- I hope to learn how to break down big research questions into
clear data steps, so I can become familiar with which data to
collect and how to prepare it.
- I want to focus on steady progress instead of perfection,
and remind myself that growth happens when I face challenges.

#### Muhammad Shahroz

- Get more active in team discussions and improve my communication.
- Learn the basics of working with large, real-world datasets.
- Get better at breaking down project tasks so I can contribute more consistently.
- Understand the core project workflow and how my work fits into the team’s goals.

#### Amro

- Understand how to define a data collection strategy aligned with the research question.
- Identify relevant and credible data sources (e.g., TRAC, EOIR, news reports).
- Practice extracting structured data from semi-structured or
unstructured formats (e.g., articles, CSVs).
- Learn how to document data provenance—where your data came from,
how it was processed, and any assumptions made.
- Apply data cleaning techniques (handling missing data,
reformatting, filtering by age).
- Learn how to collaborate in a team when collecting and verifying data.

#### Azza Omer

- Learn how to turn big research questions into smaller,
manageable steps to figure out what data is needed and how to prepare it.
- Gain a basic understanding of immigration law to help make
sense of the data.
- Practice turning messy or unstructured data
(like articles or raw CSV files)into clean, organized data you can work with.
- Understand how to track where data comes from and how it was processed.
- cleaning data—like filling in missing values,
reformatting columns, or filtering based on age.

### Milestone 3

#### Banu Ozyilmaz

- I want to get more experience working with real datasets and finding useful patterns.
- I want to feel more comfortable using tools like pandas and matplotlib for
  data analysis.
- I want to learn how to choose the best methods based on the research question.
- I want to focus on making clear and useful results, instead of using methods
  that are too complex.
- I want to understand the limits of the data and learn how to explain them clearly.

#### Muhammad Shahroz

- Figure out how to approach datasets that aren’t familiar and identify what’s
  important in them.
- Try out different basic analysis methods in Python to see which ones actually
  help understand the data.
- Get hands-on with making charts that clearly show what’s going on without
  overloading details.
- Watch how other teams go about things and use that to shape my own workflow.

#### Amro Mohamed

- Develop the ability to choose appropriate analysis methods based on the available
  data, apply them effectively, and interpret the results in a way that produces
  meaningful insights.

#### Muhamet Ali Isik

- My primary goal is to develop a more robust, end-to-end approach to data analysis
  by working with real-world, complex datasets rather than just textbook examples.
- I aim to strengthen my proficiency in data cleaning and in selecting the right
  analytical methods to produce meaningful insights, not just numbers.
- I want to get better at identifying the limitations and biases within the data
  itself and explain them clearly.

#### Gennadi Ershov

- Create a clear strategy for handling large datasets.
- Choose methods based on the research question, not complexity.
- Communicate data limitations clearly.

#### Muhammet Ali Isik

- I want to learn how to effectively translate complex technical findings into clear,
  simple language that could be understood by a non-technical audience.
- My goal is to improve my skills in visual storytelling—using charts and other visuals
  to make our findings more impactful—and to gain more confidence when presenting
  to a wider group.
- I aim to get better at presenting results honestly, openly discussing any uncertainties
  or limitations without undermining our findings.

#### Amro Mohamed
