# Milestone 2: Data Collection

**Milestone dates:** June 17 ‚Äì June 30

The main goal of this milestone was to decide how to model our problem domain in
data and determine what data is relevant to our research question. We focused on
collecting, cleaning, documenting, and hosting a dataset that would enable us to
study our research problem effectively. This milestone required us to translate our
theoretical research question into practical data requirements and establish a
solid foundation for our analysis.

Below is our
collective reflection on what went well, what we can improve, and what we‚Äôve learned
from working together so far.

---

## üî¥ Stop Doing

- Underestimating the time required for data collecting and processing tasks.
- Starting data collection without first establishing clear data quality standards
- Working in isolation on data tasks without regular check-ins.

---

## üü¢ Continue Doing

- Maintaining open communication about challenges and blockers as they arise.
- Documenting our data collection process thoroughly, including sources, methods,
  and decisions made.
- Supporting team members who encountered technical difficulties with tools
  and platforms.

---

## üü° Start Doing

- Establishing data validation checkpoints before moving to the next phase of
  the project.
- Creating standardized templates for data documentation to ensure consistency
  across all team members.
- Scheduling dedicated time for peer review of each other's work before
  finalizing to ensure consistency across our work.

---

## üí° Lessons Learned

- Data collection is more time-intensive than initially anticipated, especially
  when dealing with multiple data sources that require different collection
  methods.
- Clear data documentation is crucial not just for our team, but for
  reproducibility and future reference.
- Having a shared understanding of data quality standards prevents rework and
  ensures consistency across the dataset.
- Real-world data is often messier than expected, requiring more extensive cleaning
  and preprocessing than originally planned.

---

## üìä Strategy vs. Board

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What parts of our plan went as expected?

- Successfully identified relevant data sources that align with our research
  question.
- Created comprehensive documentation for our dataset.
- Set up a shared document for our dataset that all team members can access.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What parts of our plan did not work out?

- Establishing a collaborative workflow for data collection and cleaning tasks
  proved more challenging than expected due to conflicting schedules, time zone
  differences, and varying levels of experience with data tools among team members.
- Initial timeline estimates for the milestone deliverables were too optimistic,
  requiring extension of some deadlines.
- Some data sources were either inaccessible or of lower quality than
  expected.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Created backup plans for critical data sources in case primary sources became
  unavailable.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Or remove extra steps?

- Simplified some of our data sources after realizing they
  were unnecessarily complex for our research needs.
- Streamlined our documentation process by focusing on essential information
  rather than exhaustive detail for every minor decision.

## üë§ Individual Retrospectives

### Banu Ozyilmaz

#### Contributions

- Participated regularly in team meetings
- Organized meeting minutes and milestone retrospective documentation
- Created a shared Google Doc for research sources and kept it organized
- Wrote a review on how policy changes affect juvenile populations

#### Challenges  

- Had almost no availability in the first week due to personal engagements, which
  affected my early participation
- Found the technical aspects of data processing challenging due to my limited prior
  experience in this area
- Struggled to maintain steady progress throughout the milestone while managing
  other commitments

#### Progress

- Gained better understanding of how complex data collection can be in practice
- Learned about the importance of having clear data quality standards from the start
- Improved my skills in organizing and reviewing research materials from multiple
  sources
- Better understood how to balance individual work with team collaboration

### Amro Mohamed

#### Contributions

- Participated regularly in team meetings
- Identified features that should be in the Dataset
- discussed Flaws and limits to test the dataset
- Researched articles and Papers for potential data sources

#### Challenges  

- Reading through Papers and articles that is relevant to our research objectives
- Struggled to maintain steady progress throughout the milestone while managing
  other commitments

#### Progress

- Gained better understanding of how complex data collection can be in practice
- Learned about the importance of setting the features that we need before searching
  for data
- Improved my skills in organizing and reviewing research materials from multiple
  sources
- Better understood how to balance individual work with team collaboration

### Gennadii Ershov

#### Contributions

- Attended team meetings regularly  
- Created the README file documenting the source dataset  
- Built a Jupyter notebook to document the cleaning and formatting process  
- Researched external resources to better understand the dataset  

#### Challenges

- Very limited availability due to other commitments  
- Data cleaning has been extremely time-consuming, which is why it's still
  in progress  

#### Progress

- Developed a more thoughtful and structured approach to data analysis  
- Improved collaboration and teamwork skills  

### Muhammad Shahroz

#### Contributions

- Reviewed team notes and key features for the dataset
- Provided input on possible data limitations and flaws
- Kept up with major decisions and progress via GitHub and team updates
- Flagged a few edge cases and shared suggestions on feature definitions

#### Challenges

- Struggled to attend meetings regularly due to other commitments
- Communication and teamwork have been a bit challenging for me this milestone
- Still getting up to speed on the data sources and technical details
- Finding it hard to balance project work with other responsibilities

#### Progress

- Gained a better understanding of the main project goals and dataset structure
- Learned more about the importance of consistent feature definitions and data quality
- Working to become more active in team discussions moving forward
- Improved at reviewing discussions and sharing feedback, even when not fully
  present in meetings
