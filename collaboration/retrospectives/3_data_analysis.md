# Milestone 3: Data Analysis

**Milestone dates:** July 1 ‚Äì July 21

The main goal of this milestone was to identify and apply appropriate analysis
techniques that matched our research questions, data characteristics, and
team constraints. We focused on selecting methods that would effectively
answer our research questions while being realistic about our technical
capabilities and the nature of our dataset. This milestone also welcomed
Muhammet Isik, who joined us from Group DECQ to contribute to our work.

Below is our collective reflection on what went well, what we can improve, and
what we‚Äôve learned from working together during this phase.

---

## üî¥ Stop Doing

- Overestimating our available time windows given competing commitments and
  coordination challenges.  
- Working on tasks in isolation without sharing progress early;
  regular check-ins help us stay better aligned.

---

## üü¢ Continue Doing

- Maintaining realistic expectations about our technical capabilities and
  choosing appropriate analysis methods accordingly.  
- Supporting each other through the learning curve of working with complex,
  real-world datasets.  
- Maintaining open communication about challenges and blockers as they arise.

---

## üü° Start Doing

- Setting up more frequent check-ins to maintain momentum and keep everyone
  aligned on progress.  
- Creating clearer task distribution early in the milestone to maximize
  our collective efficiency.  
- Establishing better communication protocols to stay connected when working
  asynchronously across different schedules.  
- Planning analysis phases with more realistic buffer time for unexpected
  data challenges.

---

## üí° Lessons Learned

- Government datasets are authoritative, but also often large, messy, and
  time-consuming to clean.  
- Real-world data analysis often involves more iterative problem-solving than
  expected.  
- Choosing simpler techniques that align with our question and constraints
  (e.g., chi-square tests, time series analysis, logistic regression) can be
  more impactful than complex ones.  
- Flexibility is essential as the team navigates between gaps in availability,
  skill levels, and time zones.  
- Having a range of experience levels has supported shared learning, even when
  progress was uneven.

## üìä Strategy vs. Board

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What parts of our plan went as expected?

- Successfully identified analysis techniques (chi-square, time series,
  logistic regression) that are appropriate for our research questions and
  skill level.  
- Maintained focus on matching analysis methods to our actual constraints
  rather than pursuing overly complex approaches.  
- Found that our emphasis on simplicity and appropriateness over sophistication
  aligned well with the milestone objectives.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What parts of our plan did not work out?

- Coordination across different schedules and time zones proved more
  challenging than anticipated, requiring us to adapt to more asynchronous
  work patterns.  
- The comprehensive nature of our government dataset required more extensive
  preprocessing work than initially planned.  
- We spent significant time during this milestone on cleaning tasks that we
  had originally hoped to finish earlier.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Enhanced our data cleaning and validation processes to properly handle the
  characteristics of our comprehensive dataset.  
- Adapted to more asynchronous work patterns than originally planned due to
  scheduling coordination needs.  
- Initially, we had not planned to use 'absentia' outcomes as a measure of
  representation. However, since our first-selected tables did not include
  reliable legal representation data and the dataset was too large to explore
  everything in time,
  we temporarily used 'absentia' data as a proxy to keep analysis moving.  
  Fortunately, our teammates later discovered and cleaned another table
  containing actual legal representation information.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Or remove extra steps?

- Streamlined our approach to focus on core analysis techniques rather than
  exploring every possible method.
