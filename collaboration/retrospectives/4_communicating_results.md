# Milestone 4: Communicating Results

**Milestone dates:** July 22 ‚Äì August 11

The main goal of this milestone was to translate our research findings into
clear messages and create a strategy to reach our target audience. We focused
on preparing materials that make our work useful for professionals in NGOs and
legal scholars working on immigration policy. This required adapting our
results for different audiences, choosing appropriate channels, and presenting
findings in an accessible way.

Below is our team reflection on what went well, what we can improve, and what
we've learned from working together.

---

## üî¥ **Stop Doing**

- Working individually on different components without establishing regular
  coordination points.
- Underestimating the time needed for multiple rounds of revisions and
  refinements.

---

## üü¢ **Continue Doing**

- Holding regular meetings when possible and maintaining communication through
  online channels, while recognizing that more frequent coordination would
  strengthen our collaborative efforts.
- Keeping documentation clear and organized for team understanding and future
  reference.
- Assigning responsibilities that match members' strengths while keeping major
  decisions collaborative to make use of expertise and preserve team coherence.

---

## üü° **Start Doing**

- Implement a clear task-tracking system with assigned owners and regular
  check-ins to surface blockers and keep milestones on track.
- Build explicit time buffers into schedules to allow for iterative revisions
  and unexpected rounds of feedback or testing.
- Begin direct outreach to relevant organizations using tailored approaches
  that demonstrate understanding of their specific priorities and needs.

---

## üí° **Lessons Learned**

- Effective outreach and communication require more time, iteration, and
  strategic planning than initially anticipated.
- External reviewers and presentation audiences reveal blind spots and suggest
  concrete improvements we might miss internally.
- Clear processes, role definitions, and regular communication rhythms improve
  coordination, especially for teams working across schedules and time zones.
- Using multiple channels expands reach but needs prioritization to preserve
  quality and manage limited resources effectively.

## üìä **Strategy vs. Board**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **What parts of our plan went as expected?**

- We defined our target audience early, which helped focus our content
  development and communication approach for NGO professionals and legal
  scholars working in immigration policy.
- We launched a website that presents findings clearly, using thoughtful visual
  layout and intuitive navigation to make complex research results accessible.
- We developed initial outreach templates and structured approaches for
  organizational contact, creating a foundation for engagement efforts.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **What parts of our plan did not work out?**

- We shifted to more asynchronous collaboration than originally planned, which
  sometimes required additional coordination effort to maintain team alignment.
- Creating materials that balance technical accuracy and readability took more
  revision cycles than originally anticipated.
- Several planned deliverables required timeline adjustments to maintain
  quality within available resources.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?**

- We organized an additional meeting with Evan to discuss and refine our approach
  for engaging with target audience organizations.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Or remove extra steps?**

- Simplified our communication materials to highlight key findings rather than
  attempting to include all analytical details, making them more digestible for
  our target audience.
- Narrowed our scope to focus on specific audience segments rather than
  attempting to serve all potential stakeholders.

## üë§ Individual Retrospectives

### Banu Ozyilmaz

#### Individual Contributions

- Drafted the document identifying our target audience, their capabilities,
  constraints, and effective communication approaches.
- Created initial retrospective content for the milestone file,
  documenting our progress and key observations
- Uploaded all meeting minutes to the repository, ensuring transparency in our
  decision-making process.
- Created an email template designed for direct audience outreach.
- Participated actively in team discussions to refine our communication strategy
  and approach.
- Helped review and edit the final deliverables before submission to ensure clarity
  and quality.

#### Challenges

- I had never written this type of audience analysis document before, which made
  it difficult to know if my approach was effective.
- Finding the right tone for professional emails to NGOs and legal scholars was
  challenging as I haven't communicated with these groups before.
- Coordinating with team members across different time zones and daily life commitments
  sometimes created delays in feedback and revisions.

#### Progress

- I got better at understanding different audience needs before creating materials.
- I improved my writing skills for professional specialized audiences like NGOs
  and legal scholars, learning how to balance formality with clarity.
- I learned how to plan communication across multiple channels (website, email, etc.)
  and some new channels like Medium.
