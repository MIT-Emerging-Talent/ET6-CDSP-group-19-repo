# Milestone 5: Final Presentation

**Milestone dates:** August 12 ‚Äì August 25

The main goal of this milestone was to synthesize our work into a compelling
2.5-minute presentation for friends, family, Emerging Talent partners, and
potential employers. We focused on clearly communicating our research findings,
project evolution, lessons learned, and future directions. This milestone
challenged us to distill months of work into a concise narrative that
demonstrates both our technical capabilities and communication skills.

Below is our team reflection on what went well, what we can improve, and what
we've learned from working together.

---

## üî¥ **Stop Doing**

- Working individually on different tasks without regular
  coordination points for slide content and narrative flow.  
- Underestimating the time needed for multiple rounds of practice and
  refinement to meet the 2.5-minute target.  
- Leaving preparation of our tasks until the final days without enough time for rehearsal
  and feedback.

---

## üü¢ **Continue Doing**

- Leveraging individual strengths while ensuring meaningful contributions from  
  all team members.  
- Maintaining clear documentation of our project evolution.
- Using visual aids and storytelling to make complex research accessible to  
  diverse audiences.

---

## üü° **Start Doing**

- Have regular check-ins where we share specific updates on our tasks.
- Create buddy systems within the team where members can help each other finish tasks
  and step in when needed.
- Make backup plans that expect different levels of availability from team members
  throughout the milestone.

---

## üí° **Lessons Learned**

- Condensing months of work into 2.5 minutes requires ruthless prioritization
  and clear messaging.  
- Different audiences need slightly different emphasis while keeping the core
  story intact.  
- Presentation skills are as vital as technical skills for communicating impact.
- Live settings reveal communication gaps not seen in written materials.  

---

## üìä **Strategy vs. Reality**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **What parts of our plan went as expected?**

- We set up clear task assignments early in the milestone, which gave good structure
  for individual work planning.
- We created a cohesive presentation covering our artifact, evolution,
  learnings, and future directions.  
- Previous documentation provided a strong foundation for content development.  
- We stayed focused on our target audience while keeping content accessible.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **What parts of our plan did not work out?**

- Asynchronous collaboration made coordinated practice more difficult.  
- Initial drafts exceeded the time limit, requiring multiple reductions.  
- Scheduling group rehearsals was challenging and limited feedback opportunities.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?**

- Added more one-on-one communication between active team members to coordinate work
  when group discussions weren't happening regularly.
- Conducted a thorough repository review and cleanup to make our code and documentation
  more organized and approachable for external viewer.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Or remove extra steps?**

- Simplified structure to focus on impactful elements rather than full coverage.
- Reduced technical details to prioritize clarity and impact.  
- Streamlined visuals to support the narrative within time constraints.

## üë§ Individual Retrospectives

### Banu Ozyilmaz

#### Contributions

- Helped prepare the presentation content and structure for our team presenter.
- Created an email account to facilitate communication with our target audience.
- Maintained repository organization and kept documentation updated consistently.
- Added initial retrospectives and milestone meetings to relevant folders.

#### Challenges

- Simplifying our technical work for a mixed audience required careful consideration.
- Coordinating team efforts while balancing individual responsibilities proved challenging.
- Ensuring all project components were ready for the final presentation was demanding.
- Distilling three months of research and collaboration into a 2.5-minute pitch
  pushed me to rethink everything‚Äîwhat truly mattered, what could be left out,
  and how to say it all with impact.
  
#### Progress

- My project organization and documentation skills improved significantly.
- I developed better collaboration skills by supporting team preparation efforts.
- My ability to communicate technical concepts to diverse audiences grew.
