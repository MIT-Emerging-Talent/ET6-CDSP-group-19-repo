# Milestone 1: Domain Study

**Milestone dates:** June 3 ‚Äì June 16

---

## Main goal of Milestone 1

The main goal of this milestone was to brainstorm research ideas
using divergent thinking and select one using convergent thinking.
The goal was also to conduct a background study of our research domain
to understand what is already known and identify gaps worth exploring.
Finally, we set out to define a research question that meets
the FRESCO criteria: **Feasible, Relevant, Ethical, Specific, Complex, and Original.**

## üî¥ Stop Doing

- Being inactive for long periods without informing the team in advance, which  
  can unintentionally disrupt collaboration.  
- Accumulating work until near the deadline,
which increases stress and reduces quality.

---

## üü¢ Continue Doing

- Communicating clearly and respectfully across time zones and cultures.  
- Collaborating effectively through synchronous work, where team members worked
  on the same task at the same time professionally.  
- Maintaining strong commitment to meeting times, with all active members attending
  on time.

---

## üü° Start Doing

- Setting a meeting agenda in advance and making meetings more systematic
by discussing agenda items one by one,
ensuring a decision is made before moving on.  
- Adding brief summaries after each meeting to ensure everyone is on the same page,
  and creating a clear task list from what was agreed.

## üí° Lessons Learned

Sometimes what appears to be a difference of opinion
is caused by misunderstanding each other‚Äôs points,
when in fact we already agree. This can lead to wasting time  
discussing points we actually agree on.
