# 🚧 Constraints

Some boundaries around our project to guide effective collaboration and planning.

---

## 🔒 Project Boundaries & Constraints

To ensure efficiency and balanced contributions, the project should have clear boundaries:

- 👥 Roles and responsibilities should be well-defined to prevent overlapping efforts.
- 🎯 Expectations should be set for balanced contributions,
considering members' constraints.
- 💬 A culture of constructive feedback and solution-focused discussions
should be established.
- 🧩 A clear process for resolving conflicts is essential.

These boundaries aim to create a productive and supportive environment for the team.

## 🌍 External Constraints

The team faces several external constraints impacting collaboration:

- 🕒 **Timezones:** Remote work across different timezones can be challenging.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Family & Work Responsibilities:** Some members are constrained by
family and work commitments.
- ⏳ **Strict Deadline:** We must meet a strict project deadline.
- 📚 **Learning Curve:** We need to learn and share a large amount of new
material in a limited time.
- 📵 **Real-time Communication:** Significant timezone differences make
real-time coordination difficult.

## Milestone 0

## ⚙️ Internal Involuntary Constraints

These are constraints from within the team that are beyond individual control:

1. 🧠 **Limited Git/GitHub knowledge** – some members are still building proficiency.
2. ⌚ **Time availability** – team members have limited hours during the week.
3. 📅 **Scheduling conflicts** due to personal commitments.
4. 🔄 **Progress dependencies** – tasks sometimes rely on others' input or decisions.
5. 💻 **Limited programming or data analysis experience** in some team members.

These constraints may create hurdles in both skill development and collaboration.

## 🛠️ Internal Voluntary Constraints

These are commitments the team has voluntarily agreed to:

- 📆 **Daily Progress Updates:** Team members commit to reporting progress consistently.
- 💻 **Asynchronous Communication:** Emphasis on GitHub issues, pull requests, and
other async tools.
- 🔁 **Flexible Availability:** Members with unpredictable schedules are
willing to adapt to contribute meaningfully.
- 🚀 **Skill Development Commitment:** Everyone is committed to improving their
technical and collaborative skills.
- 🌱 **Learning Mindset:** Despite limited experience, members view this as
an opportunity to grow.

## Milestone 1

### 🧍‍♂️ Individual Constraints

#### Constraints (Banu)

- ⏳ **Time limitations**:
We have only two weeks to complete this milestone,
and progress is further challenged by differing time zones
and personal commitments that make synchronous collaboration difficult.
- 📘 **Limited knowledge and no prior experience**:
I have no prior experience in data science research,
which makes it harder to adapt to the process and slows down decision-making.
- 🧠 **Unfamiliarity with domain-specific thinking**:
Coming from a different academic background,
I find it challenging to approach problems using a data-driven mindset,
especially when it comes to identifying what makes a question suitable for research.

#### Constraints (Gennadii)

- ⏱️ **Time management**:
It’s been extremely challenging to fully commit to the project
while juggling other responsibilities.
- 🤝 **Collaboration**:
Team building can be difficult,
especially when working with people from different backgrounds and perspectives.
- 🧩 **Sharing responsibilities**:
Delegating tasks and ensuring balance within the team is
something I’m still working on.

#### Constraints (Shahroz)

- 🕒 **Job timing conflicts**:
My work hours often overlap with team meetings,
making it difficult to attend live collaboration sessions.
- 🌍 **Time zone differences**:Team members are spread across
multiple time zones, causing challenges in scheduling synchronous work.
- 📅 **Limited weekend availability**:
Although weekends are my main opportunity to focus,
personal commitments limit their flexibility.

#### Constraints (Elshikh-Amro)

- 📚 **Limited knowledge of the topics**
- ⏰ **Time management**
- 📌 **Divide the tasks**

#### Constraints (Azza)

- 📖 **Limited Background Knowledge**:
I have limited prior knowledge or experience regarding the specific problem area.
- 📊 **Time Management Challenges**:
It takes time to understand the project requirements,
align on goals, and brainstorm collectively,
which can affect the overall workflow and productivity.

## Milestone 2

## Individual Constraints

---

## Gennadii Ershov

- Extremely limited time availability over the past few weeks.
- No prior experience working with such a large dataset.
- Limited background in immigration justice,
which makes interpreting features and
trends more challenging.

## Banu Ozyilmaz

- I don’t have much experience with data processing
tools and technical workflows, which could make some tasks take longer.
- I have personal commitments that might affect
when I am available during some weeks.
- I need to balance learning new skills with meeting
the deadlines of this project.
- I often spend extra time trying to fully understand concepts
, which sometimes slows down my progress.

## Muhammad Shahroz

- Haven’t been able to attend many team meetings due to
scheduling conflicts and other commitments.
- Still catching up on the technical details and project workflow.
- Communication with the team has been a challenge for me this milestone.
- Not fully comfortable yet with large datasets or immigration data.

## Amro

- Limited access to official court-level datasets,
especially recent ones for FY 2025.
- Missing or incomplete variables (e.g., age or legal
representation may not be directly included).
- Inconsistency in how juveniles are flagged in EOIR data over time.
- Potential bias in secondary sources (e.g., media reports or advocacy articles).
- Time constraints to complete the milestone before a deadline.
- Technical barriers like managing large CSVs.

## Azza Omer

- I haven’t worked with a dataset this large before, so it’s
been challenging to manage and understand.

- I don’t have much knowledge about immigration justice,
which makes it tough to make sense of the data and spot patterns.

- It's technically challenging to handle large CSV files—they
can be slow or difficult to work with.
