## Presentation Script

This presentation, prepared by *The Data Detectives*, is titled **‚ÄúBarriers
to Justice: Immigration Policies & Immigrant Youth.‚Äù** It explores how
changes in U.S. immigration policy affect access to legal representation
and outcomes for immigrant juveniles seeking protection.

### Introduction ‚Äì The Reality We Face

We begin with three important facts.  

**First**, America thrives on diversity. This nation has been built by
immigrants from every culture and community, all contributing to its
strength.  

**Second**, border crossing violations carry legal consequences. But the
impact extends far beyond the individual, often affecting entire families.  

**Third**, children bear the cost. Separated from their parents, and
sometimes even processed as adults, they face consequences for decisions
they never made.  

The numbers illustrate this reality: in 2023 alone, more than 152,000
children were encountered at the border, with nearly 119,000 placed in
federal custody. Since 2009, almost 800,000 children have been
apprehended‚Äîequivalent to the size of a major city.  

The key question is: *What does this mean for children caught in the
immigration system?*

### Our Core Question

Our research question is:  
**How do changes in U.S. immigration policy under different
administrations affect access to legal representation and outcomes for
immigrant juveniles seeking protection?**

To answer this, we applied systematic thinking. We identified the **what,
why, and when** of immigration policies and transformed them into
features and records that could be modeled and analyzed.

### Policy Eras

We focused on three distinct eras:  

1. **Zero Tolerance Era (April 2018 ‚Äì January 2021):** Adults crossing
illegally were jailed, and children were separated into shelters as a
deterrent.  
2. **Policy Stability Era (January 2021 ‚Äì April 2025):** The Zero Tolerance
policy was rescinded to undo the harms of family separation.  
3. **Funding Cut Era (April 2025 ‚Äì Present):** Legal services funding was
cut, limiting access to attorneys for unaccompanied children.  

Our process followed a clear path:  
*Raw government data ‚Üí Cleaning & rigorous analysis ‚Üí Insights ‚Üí
Actionable measures.*

### Key Findings

Our most valuable discovery is that **juveniles with representation are
five times more likely to achieve favorable outcomes.**  

We also found that policy environments matter. During the Biden era,
favorable outcomes rose to 37.1%, compared to only 20.6% and 22.7%
in the Trump policy periods.  

The conclusion is clear: while policy matters, the single strongest factor
is whether or not a child has an attorney.

### Recommendations for Change

Our findings point to three clear actions:  

1. **Increase Legal Aid Funding** ‚Äì Strengthen resources for organizations
that provide pro bono legal services to immigrant youth.  
2. **Mandate Representation** ‚Äì Ensure that all juvenile cases include
legal counsel for equitable access to justice.  
3. **Specialized Training** ‚Äì Provide targeted training for judges and
court staff handling juvenile immigration cases.  

Together, these interventions can significantly improve outcomes and
uphold the rights of vulnerable youth.

### Communication Strategy

Research is only impactful when it reaches the right audience. Because
this issue is both humanitarian and a matter of public opinion, we
designed a communication strategy to raise awareness.  

We are focusing on two groups:  

- **NGO Professionals** such as KIND and NIJC, who directly serve
immigrant youth and need evidence for advocacy and training.  
- **Legal Scholars and Researchers** such as Harvard Law and the Vera
Institute, who require robust datasets and data-driven
recommendations.  

KIND (Kids in Need of Defense) is a leading international NGO devoted
to protecting unaccompanied and separated children. KIND envisions a
world in which every child on the move has access to legal representation
and their rights and well-being are fully protected.  

To reach our audiences, we built an **interactive website**, are preparing
**Medium articles**, and plan direct outreach. This ensures our findings
bridge the representation gap and empower stakeholders.

### Closing

In conclusion, the journey is long, but together we can lower the barriers
to justice for immigrant youth.  

We invite readers to visit **barrierstojustice.me** for detailed reports,
data, and future updates.  

Together, we can make a difference.
