# Source Dataset

## Source

The dataset comes from the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR),  
available via [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/eoir-case-data).  
It contains raw case-level data on immigration court proceedings, including  
juvenile cases, and covers the period from 2008 to the present.

We could not include the full dataset in this repository due to its size,  
but it can be accessed directly through the following link:
