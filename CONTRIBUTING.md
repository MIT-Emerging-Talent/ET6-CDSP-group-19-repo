# CONTRIBUTING.md

Welcome to The Data Detectives,

We are an international, interdisciplinary team working across time zones, cultures,
and communication styles. To ensure respectful, inclusive, and effective collaboration,  
please follow these guidelines when contributing to this project.

---

## 🌍 Be Culturally Respectful

- Assume good intent — different expressions or tones may reflect cultural habits,
not rudeness.  
- Avoid idioms, slang, or region-specific references unless you explain them.  
- Be mindful of cultural holidays and differing weekend schedules.  

---

## 🕓 Respect Time Zones and Asynchronous Work

- Don’t expect immediate responses. Allow some time for replies.  
- Use clear timestamps (with time zones) when proposing meetings or deadlines.  
- Document decisions in writing so team members in other zones stay informed.  
- Assign tasks through the GitHub Project Board so everyone can follow the workflow.

---

## 💬 Communicate Clearly

- Keep messages concise and easy to understand.  
- Use bullet points, visuals, or summaries to make complex ideas easier to follow.
- Ask for clarification when something is unclear, and be patient when others do
the same.

---

## 🎯 Contribute Inclusively

- Encourage input from all team members, especially those who may feel less
confident due to language or experience.  
- Respect different work styles, speeds, and levels of expertise.  
- Use shared documents and GitHub Issues to promote transparency and equal
participation.  

---

## 🛠 GitHub Contribution Process

- Track tasks on the GitHub Project Board — this helps us coordinate across different
time zones and prevents duplicated effort.  
- Open an **Issue** before making any significant changes. Use it to describe
your idea, get feedback, and confirm alignment with team priorities.  
- Create **Pull Requests (PRs)** linked to existing issues. Include clear descriptions
and screenshots (if applicable).  
- Every PR must be reviewed by at least **two team members** before it is merged
 — this ensures shared understanding, quality, and accountability.  
- Use **Draft PRs** if your work is still in progress but you'd like early feedback.

## 🚀 Let’s Build Together

This is a learning environment—everyone brings something valuable.  
Let’s co-create a respectful and inclusive space where differences are strengths,
and feedback is welcomed as a tool for collective growth.
